# ORM E-Commerce Back End

## Description/What I attempted to do

Build the back end for an e-commerce site by configuring an Express.js API to use Sequelize and a MySQL database. I built this application as a way to store and modify inventory data. As part of this project, I learned how to seed a database and use Express.js, Sequelize and MySQL together.
